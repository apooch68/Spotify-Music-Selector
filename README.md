## Run the application

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

Then run:

### `npm run dev`

If the application doesn't open automatically after a minute or two, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br />
If the build breaks because of a required module, navigate to <code>/Spotify-Music-Selector/src</code> and run <code>npm install</code> again. Then navigate back to the project directory and run <code>npm run dev</code> and repeat steps 3-4.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
